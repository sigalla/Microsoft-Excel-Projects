Welcome to my space!
I’m currently on a self-directed learning journey to become a Data Analyst. 
As part of my studies and practical experience, I’ve developed several data analysis projects built entirely in Microsoft Excel, 
which you’ll find showcased here. I’m also expanding my skills in SQL and Tableau, and I look forward to sharing more advanced projects as I progress. 
Additionally, you can find video presentations of these projects on TikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@xcelboy1?_t=ZM-90LrZBcGr1w&_r=1, 
where I demonstrate how they were created and analyzed.
Thank you for visiting and taking the time to explore my work!
